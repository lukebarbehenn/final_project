This project is a weather analysis app. It scrapes data from OpenWeather API and provides an analysis and recomendation based on it. 
The user will be able to choose from locations in DC, Maryland, and Virginia, and find out the weather, temperature, and 
    humidity for the chosen location. The locations are based on the latitude and longitude 

How to use the program:

1. Run the script by selecting "Run Python File," the terminal will then appear.
2. You will be prompted with a message saying to enter a state (DC, MD, or VA), enter one of these states.
3. If you chose MD or VA, you will be given a choice of 2 cities to choose from, enter one of these cities. If you chose DC, this step 
    does not apply.
4. Based on the city you chose, the current weather, temperature, feels like, and humidty will be displayed.
5. You will then be asked to enter the temperature, humidity, and weather based on the values returned.
6. The terminal will then display an analysis and recomendation based on the values entered. For exmaple if the weather was rainy, 65 degrees, 
    and the humidity was 63, the terminal would print out "Weather is mild or moderately humid" and "Its going to rain; don't forget to carry an
    umbrella!"
